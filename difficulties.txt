1. Game
    - waiting till element in search results will be interactable and not just visible
    - click on "play" button and not on "used element" detected before
    - verifying game is loading - never worked with iframe. Took some time to make it work.

2. Language Switching
    - fixtures still do not work as it written in Cypress documentation

3. Main Site Navigation
    - Cypress is to fast at clicking - needed to slow it down.
